# This workflow demonstrates a complex execution flow with multiple jobs and dependencies.
# It includes a build job that generates outputs and a deploy job that uses those outputs.
# The deploy job is conditional based on the build job's output status.
# The build job also includes a step that intentionally makes a mistake to show how it affects the workflow.
# The workflow is triggered manually with a choice input for the build status.
# The build job outputs are printed in the deploy job.
